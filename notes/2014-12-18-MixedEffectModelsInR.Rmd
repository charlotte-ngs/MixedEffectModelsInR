## Introduction
Mixed-effect models are a powerful and flexible tool to analyze grouped data which arise in areas like agriculture, biology, economics, geophysics and many more. 

`TODO: More motivation should come here ...`

In what follows, the topic of mixed-effect models is introduced around some example data analyses which are believed to be instructive. Theory behind mixed-effect models is summarized as much as it seams useful in explaining results of the examples. As a guideline, the book by Pinheiro and Bates [@PB2000] is used.
